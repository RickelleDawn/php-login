                    Thank you so much for taking the time to create an account. In the nicest way possible, I hope you encountered

                    <p> I decided to learn PHP after realizing that almost 80% of of websites are 
                    powered by PHP, including big names like FaceBook, Wikipedia, and of course WordPress. After being
                     around for more than 25 years, it has certainly proven itself a strong contender in the realm of programming languages. <p> 
                    <p>This project was built from scratch using PHP, MySQL, HTML, and CSS. For now, it is a very basic app with the sole purpose
                     of allowing users to create a new account, log in, and log out. Please, dont just check it out- live recklessly! Button smash 
                     and see if anything breaks.. and let me know what you think!</p></div>';
